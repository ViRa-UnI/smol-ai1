Here is the code for the file frontend/src/components/MarketingPromotion.js:

```javascript
import React from 'react';

const MarketingPromotion = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Marketing and Promotion</h1>
      <p>Develop a marketing strategy to promote the app through social media, content marketing, and other channels to attract users.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MarketingPromotion;
```

This code defines a functional component `MarketingPromotion` that renders a heading and a paragraph describing the marketing and promotion strategy for the app.
